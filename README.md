# Adversarial recommenders
This repo contains code for implementing adversarial recommender systems as discussed in the following paper:

"On incorporating side information into linear recommender systems using adversarial training" 
by *Dora Jambor* and *Putra Manggala*.

Code shared in this repository is unfortunately only partial due to dependencies with private datasets. I hope that you will still find this helpful in using our proposed method for side-information incorporation into recommender systems.
